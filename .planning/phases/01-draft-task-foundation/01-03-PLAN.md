<objective>
Build approval workflow with draft-to-formal conversion and cascade deletion

Purpose: When work order is approved, convert draft tasks to formal tasks; when rejected, delete draft tasks entirely

Output: Approval workflow with automatic draft task conversion/deletion
</objective>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add convert_draft_tasks method to WorkOrder</name>
  <files>backend/workorder/models/core.py</files>
  <action>
    Add convert_draft_tasks method to WorkOrder class:
    1. Add method after the validate_before_approval method (around line 236)
    2. Method should:
       - Use transaction.atomic() for atomic operation
       - Run data integrity validation before conversion:
         * Check all draft tasks have non-empty name field
         * Verify all draft tasks have valid work_order_process foreign key
         * Verify all draft tasks have process_code set
         * Raise ValidationError if any validation fails
       - Query all draft tasks: WorkOrderTask.objects.filter(work_order_process__work_order=self, status='draft')
       - Update status from 'draft' to 'pending' using bulk_update (more efficient than individual saves)
       - Set updated_at timestamp
       - Log the conversion (create TaskLog entries for converted tasks)
       - Return count of converted tasks

    The method signature:
    ```python
    def convert_draft_tasks(self):
        \"\"\"Convert all draft tasks to formal tasks (pending status)

        Called when work order is approved. Validates data integrity
        before conversion to ensure all required fields are populated.

        Returns:
            int: Number of tasks converted

        Raises:
            ValidationError: If draft tasks have missing required data
        \"\"\"
    ```

    Implementation should use bulk_update for performance with large task counts.

    Data integrity checks (CONS-04):
    - name: must be non-empty
    - work_order_process: foreign key must be valid
    - process_code: must be set
    - No orphaned draft tasks (all must belong to a process)
  </action>

  <done>WorkOrder has convert_draft_tasks method that validates data integrity before converting draft to pending</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add delete_draft_tasks method to WorkOrder</name>
  <files>backend/workorder/models/core.py</files>
  <action>
    Add delete_draft_tasks method to WorkOrder class:
    1. Add method after convert_draft_tasks
    2. Method should:
       - Use transaction.atomic() for atomic operation
       - Query all draft tasks: WorkOrderTask.objects.filter(work_order_process__work_order=self, status='draft')
       - Delete using queryset.delete() (cascades properly)
       - Log the deletion (optional, for audit trail)
       - Return count of deleted tasks

    The method signature:
    ```python
    def delete_draft_tasks(self):
        \"\"\"Delete all draft tasks for this work order

        Called when work order is rejected. Draft tasks are not needed
        and should be removed to keep database clean.

        Returns:
            int: Number of tasks deleted
        \"\"\"
    ```

    This uses Django's cascade deletion - related TaskLog entries will also be deleted.
  </action>

  <done>WorkOrder has delete_draft_tasks method that removes all draft tasks</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Integrate draft task handling into approve action</name>
  <files>backend/workorder/views/work_orders.py</files>
  <action>
    Update the approve action in WorkOrderViewSet (around line 238):
    1. Find the existing approve method
    2. After work_order.save() on approval (around line 319):
       - If approval_status == 'approved': call work_order.convert_draft_tasks()
       - If approval_status == 'rejected': call work_order.delete_draft_tasks()
    3. Add the converted/deleted task count to response
    4. Update notification content to include task conversion/deletion info

    The integration should be:
    ```python
    # After work_order.save()
    if approval_status == 'approved':
        converted_count = work_order.convert_draft_tasks()
        # Include in response
    elif approval_status == 'rejected':
        deleted_count = work_order.delete_draft_tasks()
        # Include in response
    ```

    Ensure transaction rollback if any part fails.
  </action>
  <verify>grep -A10 "approval_status == 'approved'" backend/workorder/views/work_orders.py | grep -c "convert_draft_tasks"</verify>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add cascade deletion validation for work orders</name>
  <files>backend/workorder/models/core.py backend/workorder/views/work_orders.py</files>
  <action>
    Add cascade deletion validation to ensure deleting a work order properly deletes all associated draft tasks (CONS-03 requirement):

    1. In backend/workorder/models/core.py:
       - Verify WorkOrderTask model has on_delete=CASCADE for work_order_process foreign key
       - Add a test method to verify cascade behavior:
         * Create a test work order with draft tasks
         * Delete the work order
         * Verify all draft tasks are deleted (no orphaned tasks)

    2. In backend/workorder/views/work_orders.py:
       - Add explicit deletion handling in WorkOrderViewSet.destroy method:
         * Before deleting work order, count draft tasks
         * After deletion, verify tasks are deleted (query should return 0)
         * Log the cascade deletion for audit trail

    3. Data integrity check for cascade deletion (CONS-03):
       - Verify no orphaned WorkOrderTask entries exist after work order deletion
       - Query: WorkOrderTask.objects.filter(work_order_process__work_order__isnull=True).count() should be 0
       - If orphaned tasks found, log warning and clean up

    The cascade deletion should be tested by:
    - Creating a work order with draft tasks
    - Deleting the work order
    - Verifying draft tasks are deleted (not orphaned)
  </action>
  <verify>grep -n "on_delete.*CASCADE" backend/workorder/models/core.py | head -5</verify>
  <done>WorkOrder deletion cascades to delete all associated draft tasks (no orphaned tasks)</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add draft task constraint to model</name>
  <files>backend/workorder/models/core.py</files>
  <action>
    Add model-level constraint to prevent draft task status changes to other statuses without going through proper workflow:
    1. Override save() method in WorkOrderTask if not already overridden for status validation
    2. Add validation: if status is changing from 'draft' to something else, verify work order is approved
    3. This ensures draft tasks can only become formal through the approval workflow

    Alternative: Add a clean() method that validates:
    - If status == 'draft', no assigned_operator or assigned_department should be set
    - Draft tasks cannot be directly edited to 'in_progress' or 'completed'

    Location: Add to WorkOrderTask class (around line 1073)

    This prevents accidental status transitions that bypass the approval workflow.
  </action>
  <verify>grep -n "def clean\|def save.*status" backend/workorder/models/core.py | grep -A2 "WorkOrderTask"</verify>
  <done>WorkOrderTask has validation preventing draft task status changes outside approval workflow</done>
</task>

</tasks>

After completion, verify:
1. Create work order -> verify draft tasks exist
2. Approve work order -> verify draft tasks converted to pending
3. Reject work order -> verify draft tasks deleted
4. Delete work order -> verify all draft tasks are deleted (no orphaned tasks)
5. Try to edit draft task directly to 'in_progress' -> should fail validation
6. Test transaction rollback: if conversion fails midway, no partial updates
7. Data integrity test: try to convert draft tasks with missing required fields -> should fail with ValidationError
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Approving work order converts all draft tasks to pending status
- Rejecting work order deletes all draft tasks
- Deleting a work order cascades to delete all associated draft tasks
- Draft task conversion validates data integrity (required fields populated)
- Draft task conversion/deletion is atomic (transaction-wrapped)
- Cannot bypass approval workflow by editing draft task status directly
</success_criteria>
